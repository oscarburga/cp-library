# cp-library
This repository contains my implementation of some algorithms and data structures for use in competitive programming. 

These codes were written mostly by myself, taking some inspiration from [Ecnerwala's CP Book](https://github.com/ecnerwala/cp-book), [KACTL](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl) and everything [Racsosabe](https://github.com/racsosabe) taught me.
