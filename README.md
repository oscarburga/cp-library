# cp-library
This repository contains my implementation of some algorithms and data structures for use in competitive programming. 

These codes were written mostly by myself, taking some inspiration from [Ecnerwala's CP Book](https://github.com/ecnerwala/cp-book), [KACTL](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl) and everything [Racsosabe](https://github.com/racsosabe) taught me.

Note: Most of the codes in the tree and data structures sections I don't actually use myself and are there just for the sake of completion or as references (this is also the reason why these sections are fairly empty and not so well-written). I usually just hand-write them when I need them anyways.
